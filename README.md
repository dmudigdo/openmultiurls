#openmultiurls

A simple Python script that opens a text file with multiple URLs (one per line), and then opens a browser window for each of these URLs.

##Background

At the moment this is the shortest practical python program I have written. While looking for second-hand cars, I collected car URLs in a text file, in view of opening them later. After collecting about 12 URLs, I figured that instead of copy-pasting each URL into my browser, I could turn to a Python script.

##Usage

    python openmultiurls.py

(Place your URLs, one per line, in a text file called `urls.txt`)
